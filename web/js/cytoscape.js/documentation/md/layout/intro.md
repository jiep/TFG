The function of a layout is to set the positions on the nodes in the graph.  Layouts are [extensions](#extensions/layouts) of Cytoscape.js such that it is possible for anyone to write a layout without modifying the library itself.

Several layouts are included with Cytoscape.js by default, and their options are described in the sections that follow with the default values specified.  Note that you must set `options.name` to the name of the layout to specify which one you want to run.
